# Lesson 7: Organizing Code with Functions

## Quiz
#### 1. What is the scope of variables declared in a function's prototype?
The variables scope in the function's prototype

#### 2. What is the nature of the value passed to this function?
#### `int Func(int &someNumber)`
The value is a reference to the variable someNumber. 

#### 3. You have a function that invokes itself. What is such a function called?
This is called a recursive function

#### 4. You have declared two functions, both with the same name and return type but different paraemeter lists. What are these called?
Function overload.

#### 5. Does the stack pointer point to the top, middle, or bottom of the stack?
The stack pointer points to the top of the stack. The stack pointer works as a Last-In First-Out (LIFO), meaning that the most recent call put into the stack will be the first call taken out of the stack.
