--------------------- QUIZ Answers ---------------------
1. In a signed integer, the most-significant bit (MSB) functions as the sign bit
   and indicates whether a value should be positive or negaitve. An unsigned integer
   is used to contain only positive integer values.
  
2. #define is a preprocessor directive that directs the compiler to do a text replacement 
   wherever the defined value is seen. However, it is not type safe, and using #define is 
   a primative way of defining constants. Therefore, it is to be avoided.

3. To ensure that it contains a definite, non-random value.

4. 2. Ace = 0, Jack = 1, Queen = 2, King = 3

5. There is nothing wrong syntactically, but the name is nondescriptive and not reader friendly.
   It is better declared using a name that reveals its purpose. 
   Ex. int age = 0;
