# 4. BUG BUSTERS: What is wrong with this code?
`#include<iostream>`

`using namespace std;`

`int main()`

`{`

  `int* pointToAnInt = new int;`
  
  `pointToAnInt = 9;`

  `cout << "The value at pointToAnInt : " << *pointToAnInt;`

  `delete pointToAnInt;`

  `return 0;`

`}`

In the code above, the line `pointToAnInt = 9;` does not assign the value correctly. Instead it should be written like the following:
`*pointToAnInt = 9;`
