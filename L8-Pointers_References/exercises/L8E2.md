# 2. What are the similarities and differences between these three overloaded functions:
1. `int DoSomething(int num1, int num2);`
2. `int DoSomething(int& num1, int& num2);`
3. `int DoSomething(int* pNum1, int* pNum2);`

1. Arguments are copied into the called function.
2. Arguments are not copied as they are references to the variables in the caller, and the function can change them.
3. Arguments uses pointers, which (unlike references) can be `NULL` or invalid, and validity needs to be ensured in such a system.

- Similarities
  - Take in two parameters
  - 1 and 2 both take in integer parameters
- Differences 
  - 3 is different from the others since it takes in a pointer parameters
