# 5. BUG BUSTERS: What is wrong with this code?
`#include<iostream>`

`using namespace std;`

`int main()`

`{`

`int* pointToAnInt = new int;`

`int* pNumberCopy = pointToAnInt;`

`*pNumberCopy = 30;`

`cout << *pointToAnInt;`

`delete pNumberCopy;`

`delete pointToAnInt;`

`return 0;`

`}`

In the code above, there is a double `delete` on the same memory address returned by `new` to `pNumber` and duplicated in `pNumberCopy`. Remove one `delete`.
